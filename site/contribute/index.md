# Contribution Guide

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small! Here we summarize some general guidelines on how you can get involved in the SSM project.

## Submitting Issues And Writing Tests

We need your help! If you found a bug, it's best to [create an issue](https://github.com/SquirrelCorporation/SquirrelServersManager/issues) and follow the template we've created for you. Afterwards, create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) that replicates the issue using a test.

## Developing SSM Server

In `server`, we use vitest unit tests for test coverage (in `./server/src/tests`).
