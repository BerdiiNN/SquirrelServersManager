SSM is currently in active development and not usable for production yet. I am opensourcing it (I am alone right now working on it), so I can start collaborating with community contributors.

## Welcome

Welcome to SSM. We blend the automation powerhouse of Ansible with the portable setup of Docker in a clean and engaging interface.
Forget the days of command line complexities. Our simplified dashboard places the full potential of Ansible and Docker at your fingertips. Effortlessly navigate deployment to monitoring via clicks, not code.
Born from a love for open-source, we've crafted this toolkit to be community-backed and user-focused. It's the ideal pick for developers and IT teams who crave simplicity without sacrificing power.
Rediscover Ansible and Docker as they unite under one intuitive, open-source interface. Welcome to simplicity and power in perfect harmony.

## Why building SSM

I didn't find any tools for my Homelab that allow me to manage my 5 Rpi & 3 Ubuntu servers with a nice UI. So I decided to code it!

The goal of SSM is to wrap the best technologies for configuration, container managements in a simple interface.

## Join Us(Me)!

SSM is still in early stage. I have a lot of ground to cover, and I won't be able to do this without the help from community contributors. I am also actively looking for more team members with long term commitment
