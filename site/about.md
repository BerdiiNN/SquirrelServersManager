SSM is currently in active development and not usable for production yet. I am opensourcing it (I am alone right now working on it), so I can start collaborating with community contributors.

## Why building SSM

I didn't find any tools for my Homelab that allow me to manage my 5 Rpi & 3 ubuntu servers with a nice UI. So I decided to code it!

The goal of SSM is to wrap the best technologies for configuration, container managements in a simple interface.

SSM is still in early stage. I have a lot of ground to cover, and I won't be able to do this without the help from community contributors. I am also actively looking for more team members with long term commitment
